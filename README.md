# Interactive-Weather-App-with-Live-Data-Mapping
I created a fully responsive weather web app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Leaflet.js. The app connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live weather data and displays results on an interactive map. It allows users to search by city, view weather conditions in real time, and interact with a custom-designed map.
